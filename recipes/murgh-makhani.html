   <h1 class="recipe-name">Murgh Makhani</h1> 
    <h3 class="section-title">Description</h3>
    <p class="recipe-description">This was the first dish that I learned to cook that made me feel like I could actually
    become reasonably good at cooking. It is a relatively uncomplicated dish, despite the long
    list of ingredients, and when cooked even half-way decently it tastes better and costs less
    than most dishes that you can buy in a restaurant.</p>
    <h3 class="section-title">Ingredients</h3>
    <h4 class="subsection-title">The Marinade</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 whole chicken (or equivalent weight in chicken breasts if the idea of preparing the whole chicken
            feels a bit much for you).</li>
        <li>1-2 Tbsp lemon juice</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp tumeric powder</li>
        <li>1-2 tsp cumin powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp of chilli powder (or paprika for those that don't like spice).</li>
        <li>2 tsp coriander powder</li>
        <li>2 tsp garam masala</li>
        <li>2 tsp dried fenugreek seeds (optional)</li>
        <li>A thumb of ginger</li>
        <li>3-4 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp of oil</li>
        <li>1/2 a cup of Greek yogurt</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="subsection-title">The Sauce</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2-4 Tbsp butter</li>
        <li>1 piece of cinnamon (~8-10cm)</li>
        <li>6-8 green cardamoms</li>
        <li>6-8 cloves</li>
        <li>Another thumb of ginger</li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>1-2 green chilies (optional)</li>
        <li>1-2 tsp of red chili powder (again, paprika for those who don't like their mouth to
        be on fire!)</li>
        <li>1-2 tsp of garam masala (according to taste)</li>
        <li>1 tsp cumin powder</li>
        <li>2 tsp coriander seed powder</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp powdered fenugreek seeds</li>
        <li>600-800grams of diced tomatoes (optional - you can also use a combination of tinned
            tomatoes with a good amount of tomato puree)</li>
        <li>1-2 handfuls of cashew nuts</li>
        <li>3-4 Tbsp honey</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="section-title">Steps</h3>
    <p>Pro tip - If you want to boost the flavour of the dish, feel free to alter any of the
    spice amounts to your taste. Also, buying the whole seed versions of the spices and grinding them yourself adds a freshness to the flavour!</p>
    <h4 class="subsection-title">Preparation</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the chicken and cut into bite-size chunks.</li>
        <li>Pat down with kitchen towel to remove any excess moisture.</li>
        <li>Add the chili powder, salt and lemon juice. Mix together, cover and rest for 20mins.</li>
        <li>Finely dice the ginger together with the garlic until almost a paste and add
            alongside the garam masala, cumin, coriander, fenugreek, tumeric and greek yoghurt.
        Mix well and cover again.</li>
        <li>Allow the marinated chicken to rest for anywhere from 12-48hrs (min and max times).
        The longer you leave it, the more tender and juicier the chicken will be after cooking.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4 class="subsection-title">The Sauce</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Take the chicken out of the refrigerator, as you don't want to grill cold chicken.</li>
        <li>Add the cashews with 1/4-1/2 a cup of water to the blender. If you don't have a
            powerful blender then pre-soak the cashews in hot water for 20-30mins to soften
            them. Blend together until creamy.</li>
        <li>Remove the cashew cream, add the tomatoes and blend, the smoother the better.</li>
        <li>Heat 2Tbsp of butter in a pan and add the cinnamon cloves and cardamom whole. Once
        they start to sizzle then add green chilies along with ginger/garlic paste. Fry on a
        medium heat until the garlic and ginger are browned. <strong>Take care not to burn
            anything!</strong></li>
        <li>Stain (optional, depends on how smooth you want the sauce), the tomato puree into
            the pan.</li>
        <li>Increase the heat slightly and bring to a boil, watch out for the dreaded tomato
            sauce spray, it is an easy way to ruin a good shirt.</li>
        <li>Cover, but not fully, and allow to simmer on a medium heat until thickened. Usually
        takes 15-20mins depending on the amount.</li>
        <li>Stir in the cashew cream. Optional - add a little hot water if you feel the sauce
            is getting too thick.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4 class="subsection-title">The Chicken</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Check that the chicken isn't cold.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 210<sup>o</sup>C.</li>
        <li>Skew the chicken on water-soaked wooden skewers and place in a lightly-oiled tray
            to bake for 20-25mins, depending on the size of the chunks. Halfway, turn the
            skewers over so that both sides get evenly cooked.</li>
        <li>Cook until all of the moisture evaporates, but be careful not to dry out the
            chicken.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken to the sauce, again adding hot water if the sauce is becoming too
            thick. Cooking time can vary here, but I usually go for 10-20mins to give the sauce
        time to develop its flavours.</li>
        <li>Add salt, fenugreek and honey.</li>
        <li>Taste it. Check if any more honey, butter or spices are required. This part is
            really up to you and your taste.</li>
        <li>Add a few tablespoons of either thick cream or greek yoghurt.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4 class="subsection-title">The Veg</h4>
    <p>Traditionally, this is where the dish ends, however adding seasonal vegetables can add
    some variety to each mouthful and adds texture to the dish. It isn't strictly required, but
    I find it to be an improvment. Usually I go for brocolli, spinach, potato or cauliflower. Generally,
    vegetables that don't have too much sharpness or bitterness in their flavour are better, as
    the dish should be creamy and some vegetables can take away from that.</p>
    <h3 class="section-title">Serving</h3>
    <p>Serve with your favourite indian carb-source! Rice, roti or naan bread all work
    particularly well.</p>
