   <h1 class="recipe-name">Lemon Honey Roast Chicken</h1> 
    <h3 class="section-title">Description</h3>
    <p class="recipe-description">The ultimate comfort food! A special treat, especially for those who are currently
        stricken with a cold or the flu as it contains the classic lemon/ginger/honey combo,
        alongside being the starting point of making a great chicken soup to enjoy over the
        coming days.</p>
    <h3 class="section-title">Ingredients</h3>
    <div class="list-container">
        <ul>
            <li>1 whole chicken</li>
            <li>2-3 lemons</li>
            <li>50-75g butter</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp of honey</li>
            <li>Rosemary sprigs</li>
            <li>2-3 cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>1 thumb of ginger</li>
            <li>2 onions</li>
            <li>Peppers</li>
            <li>Carrots</li>
            <li>Potatoes</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>Paprika</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h3 class="section-title">Steps</h3>
    <h4 class="subsection-title">The Chicken</h4>
    <div class="list-container">
            <ol>
            <li>Leave the chicken whole, but carefully use a sharp knife to seperate the skin on
                the breasts from meat underneath.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 200<sup>o</sup>C.</li>
            <li>Dice the onions, ginger and garlic until almost paste-like.</li>
            <li>Cut one of the lemons into thin strips and then carefully place it under the skin,
                along with 1/2 of the
            onion/garlic/ginger paste, 1/2 of the rosemary sprigs and ~50g of the butter, cut into
            small knobs. Make sure to try and get the
            ingredients as spread out as possible.</li>
            <li>Juice and grate the remaining lemons.</li>
            <li>Melt the remaining butter in a pan on a low heat and add the grated lemon rind,
                alongside 1/4 of the onion/garlic/ginger paste, 1/2 of the salt and pepper and all
                of the honey and paprika. Stir and heat for 2-3mins.</li>
            <li>Use a basting brush to coat the entire outside of the chicken skin, as well as the inside
            of the body with this mixture. The honey adds sweetness to counteract the sour of the
            lemons, but also helps catalyze caramelisation and browning of the skin.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <h4 class="subsection-title">The Veg</h4>
    <p class="additional-info">Again, the suggested vegetables listed above in the ingredients are my personal
    favourites for this dish, but you are only limited here by your imagination!</p>
    <div class="list-container">
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the vegetables into large pieces. For an average potato, halving them, or
                quartering them
            if they are on the larger side is adequate. <strong class="pro-tips"><em>You don't want to cut them too small</em></strong>, as
            they will be in the oven for quite a while and tend to disintegrate into a sloppy mess
            if cut too finely. For the onions, slicing them into thick rings is enough.</li>
            <li>Prewarm a casserole dish or any sufficiently deep oven dish. Rub the remaining butter around the
                dish to oil it.</li>
            <li>Add the last of the onion/garlic/ginger paste to the butter along with any
                remaining rosemary and spread out to cover the dish as well as possible.</li>
            <li>Put the vegetables in the dish, salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <h4 class="subsection-title">Bringing it all together</h4>
    <p>The final step is to place the chicken on top of the vegetables and put the whole meal
    in the oven for 1 to 1hr 30mins, depending on the size of the chicken. The juices from the
    chicken will help and flavour to the underlying vegetables, ensuring the none of that
    deliciousness is wasted!</p>
    <h3 class="section-title">Serving</h3>
    <p>Serve however you like! Either present it at the table whole and in the dish it was
    cooked in then carve off pieces of
    chicken for each person, or portion the chicken and vegetables yourself in the kitchen
    before presenting.
    There's no wrong way to do it.</p>
    <p> <strong class="pro-tips"><em>Pro tip!</em></strong> Save the carcass, even though it has already been cooked through, it can still
    be used to make a delicious soup, that has the added benefit of being pre-seasoned!</p>
