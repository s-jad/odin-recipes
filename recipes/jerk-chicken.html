   <h1>Sam's Famous (Almost) Jerk Chicken</h1> 
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>An <strong><em>incredibly</em></strong> British attempt at Jamaican jerk chicken, heavily inspired by the
    phenomenal jerk chicken wraps served up at Knockengorroch World Ceildh 2023 by a truly
    wonderful couple. I missed it the moment my plate was clean.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 bottle of good ale/stout/porter</li>
        <li>6-8 fajita wraps</li>
        <li>1 whole chicken</li>
        <li>3 onions</li>
        <li>4-6 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>tomato paste</li>
        <li>6-8 fresh tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 lemon</li>
        <li>Fresh chillis (type and amount to your taste)</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp vinegar</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 tsp cumin</li>
        <li>2 tsp coriander seeds</li>
        <li>1 tsp paprika</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp all-spice</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper (amount to your taste)</li>
        <li>Seasonal vegetables</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <h4>The Sauce</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Finely dice garlic, onions, tomatoes and chillis.</li>
        <li>Fry the garlic, onions and chilli until close to golden-brown.</li>
        <li>Add 1/5 of the bottle of ale/stout/porter and simmer until most of the liquid has
            evaporated, allow the ingredients to cook for 1-2mins with very little liquid in
            the pan to allow for caramelisation.</li>
        <li>Repeat step 3 until down to the last 1/5 of a bottle.</li>
        <li>With the last 1/5 of the bottle, add the Worcestershire sauce, vinegar and half of each of
            the spices and simmer until most, but not all, of the liquid is gone. At this stage
        a thick sauce should be starting to form.</li>
        <li>Add 1/2 a tube of tomato paste and the fresh diced tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper according to your taste.</li>
        <li>Simmer for 20mins and allow to rest.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>The Chicken</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Pre-heat oven to 210<sup>o</sup>C</li>
        <li>De-bone and quarter the chicken.</li>
        <li>Place the offcuts and bones into a pot with cold water and bring to a boil for a
            approximately 2hrs to make a chicken
            stock.</li>
        <li>Rub the quartered chicken with the remaining spices, drizzle with lemon juice.</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to according to your taste.</li>
        <li>Decrease oven temperature to 180<sup>o</sup>C. Place the chicken, skin-side up, in a lightly-oiled oven dish and cook until
            golden-brown (20-30mins depending on the oven and the size of the cuts).</li>
        <li>When satisfied that the chicken is cooked, shred the chicken using a knife and
            fork.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>The Veg</h4>
    <p>For this part, really the only important thing is that the vegetables are an appropriate
    size to fit into a fajita wrap without causing the "fajita-roller" too many problems. I
    leave the choice of vegetables up to the reader, as tastes and availability can vary
    wildly.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut vegetables to an appropriate size.</li>
        <li>Coat a frying pan in some olive oil and pre-heat.</li>
        <li>Add the vegetables, salt, pepper and any other seasonings you like.</li>
        <li>Cook until delicious.</li>
        <li>If the vegetables start to dry before they are properly softened, use some of the
            chicken stock to add liquid and flavour to them.</li>
        <li>Voila!</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Serving</h3>
    <p>Serve the chicken, sauce and vegetables seperately, along with any other goodies that you
    wish to add to your wraps. Part of the fun of these dishes is the "DIY" nature of serving, where each
    person can construct <strong>their</strong> wrap in <strong>their</strong> own way.</p>
